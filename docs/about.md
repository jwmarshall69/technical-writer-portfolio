# About

I’m a Technical Writer with strengths in API docs, docs‑as‑code, and information
architecture. I partner closely with engineering and support to ship
**discoverable docs that reduce friction and tickets**.

## What I bring

- API & developer docs (OpenAPI/Swagger, Postman, REST basics)
- Docs‑as‑Code (Markdown, GitHub, CI checks, review workflows)
- Knowledge management (structure, re‑use, style, taxonomy)

**Toolbox**: GitHub, VS Code, Markdown, OpenAPI, Postman, static sites
