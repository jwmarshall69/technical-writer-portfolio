# Case Study — API Microservice

**Scenario**: Developers struggled to authenticate and make a first call.

## Actions

1) Mapped reader goals (auth ✓, first response ✓, error handling ✓)
2) Wrote task‑based quickstart with copy‑paste requests
3) Added Postman collection + environment
4) Embedded troubleshooting and common errors

## Impact

- Time‑to‑first‑call: 25 → 14 minutes (‑44%)
- New dev support tickets: ‑18% over 60 days

**Artifacts**: [OpenAPI sample](/../samples/openapi/hello-api.yaml), [Postman collection](/../samples/postman/collection.json)
